# Factory-Daily-Cost-Estimation-Using-MATLAB


This project is a complete MATLAB-based solution to estimate the **daily operational cost** of a factory. It calculates and visualizes the cost associated with:
- Raw materials (by shape: solid cylinder, hollow cylinder, plate, sphere)
- Machining operations (turning, milling, 3D printing)
- Manpower wages
- Electricity usage
- Other overheads

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- Calculates volumes for common industrial shapes.
- Computes material cost based on volume and density.
- Applies machining cost multipliers.
- Adds manpower, electricity, and miscellaneous costs.
- Generates visualizations:
  - ðŸ“Š Pie chart for total cost distribution
  - ðŸ“Š Bar charts for material and operation costs

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visuals

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `factory_cost_estimator.m` â€“ Main script
- `README.md` â€“ Project description
- `/images` â€“ Output charts and figures

## âœ… Requirements
- MATLAB R2020 or later
- No special toolboxes required

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
- Add GUI for input
- Export report as PDF
- Add batch cost estimation based on quantity
